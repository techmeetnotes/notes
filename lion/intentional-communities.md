## Some fragmentary writings on intentional communities

In Star Community, I gave a presentation on various contemporary philosophies held by men with respect to sex and romance and love.  I spoke about the mythopoetic mens movement of the 1980s and 90s, of contemporary social justice, of queer theory, of traditionalism, of polarities thinkers, of "game," and of MGTOW.  On Saturday during Spiritual Quest, we talked about many things, including, "What does it take to make a deep decision to dedicate one's life to a society of dream?"  We interrogated ourselves and found 3, maybe 4 dimensions.  The are: "Access" -- the capacity to access the idea of a dream society within oneself, "Feeling" -- the capacity to rest in the feeling of such a dream, and "Willingness" -- the willingness to work across blocks, inner and outer, towards the realization of such a dream.  A 4th might be "Expression," the capacity to express what one sees in Access, another 4th might be "Confidence," a feeling that one can move forward.

Today, I live in a community called "Songaia."

I sort of started out in my Communities investigation, in 1999.
I had just moved to Seattle, and just within months of arriving, N20 happened.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests
I was working on 6th and Olive, I had just moved up from Santa Cruz, --
I had gone to an Engineering school, called Harvey Mudd -- which I failed out of, but I found it easy enough to get programming work.
I had been focused on spirituality and mysticism, mostly, between the ages of 10-20.
So this was my first, real, direct encounter with State politics, and the political ecology as something beyond a debate on TV.
Or arguing about ideas about Libertarianism with high school and college friends or something.
I studied Noam Chomsky at the time, and this led me to explore Anarchist thought and Anarchist ideas.
I was a left anarchist, and was pepper sprayed in the streets of Seattle, a few short years later, as part of an Anarchist parade.
I met with Louis Thetford who I admired, because she created the 45th street clinic for homeless youth.
https://familymedicine.uw.edu/medex/about-medex-nw/faculty-staff/seattle-faculty/lois-thetford/
She said, "OK, but what are you doing to help people?"  Really turned around my picture of activism.
There were many ideas I was thinking about the time, but I was looking at society as a whole, for the first time, asking, "Why are things that way?"
Before, in my 10-20 period, I was mostly asking myself, "What is Real?  What is worth attention?  What is the inner spirit of life?"
It was very individually focused.  I studied in mystery schools, most specifically Eckankar and Surat Shabda Yoga.
Eckankar -- https://www.eckankar.org/
Surat Shabda Yoga -- I'm not sure of a good link for this.
Also, I had a baby.  So I was suddenly in a very different world.
I started studying communities.
There were lots of communities I looked at, but the one I read about most deeply was Twin Oaks.
And I read the book, "Is it Utopia yet?", by Kat Kinkade.
https://www.twinoaks.org/books-about-twin-oaks/is-it-utopia-yet-book-kinkade
When I think about life, and I think about community, the thing that is central to me is what I call: "Dream."
I can't think of anything else, really, for somebody who exists, to pursue.
Whether man or woman, rich or poor, Christian or Muslim, religious or atheist, --
It seems to me that all life -- at least, all life that involves some kind of a mind, that experiences, feels, and thinks thoughts -- is in pursuit of a dream.
For me, dream is central.
One of the things that Kat Kinkade experienced at Twin Oaks, --
and I really appreciated her engineering-type mind that she uses in her analysis and observation of Twin Oaks --
Was that people would come to Twin Oaks with great dreams.  And she would work really, really hard, to booster people's dreams.
She'd find relevant stakeholders, she'd find people who would be impacted, she'd find people who would be sympathetic, and she would work at getting the engines firing, so that people's dreams would come true, --
And what she found, reliably, was that -- every time -- that 50% of the population, would assemble and rise together, to put a stop to that dream.
It did not matter what it was, and it did not matter who it was.
It was like clockwork.
She came to theorize that there's some kind of a system of enforced normalcy.
"If that person's dreams are realized, then something wrong is going on, and we need to put a stop to it."
She came to view envy as one of the fundamental problems of community, and egalitarianism as its strict enabler.
She became very skeptical of egalitarianism as a system of motivation.
I think she remained an egalitarian, but she was deeply skeptical of some dimensions of egalitarianism.
Now around 2005 or 2006, at Jigsaw Renaissance, there was a core group that was taking care of the myriad dimensions of making the visions that the people had identified, happen.
And I remember new people coming in, and there was a very strong anarchist current to everything.
And people who had invested zero into the organization, we demanding to have equal say, and veto power, over the decisions of the people who were putting things together.
And I realized, "OK, people who are putting something together, need to be allowed to put something together."
I think it was close around this time that I discovered Damanhur, as well.
The vast majority of communities I studied, I called them communities based in: "The Western Anarchist Tradition."
What I call the Western Anarchist Tradition, I identify as something based around ideals such as:
* The broad distribution of power, as much as possible.
* The use of consensus, or at least the centralizing of consensus.  I would position the vision of "sociocracy" in this as well.
* Highly egalitarian values.
* A concept of "rights," a view of life through the framework of human rights.
* Non-religiousness, or symbolic religious thought.
I am not opposed to all of these things, I am just trying to sketch out the philosophical framework behind what I am calling "Western Anarchist Tradition" communities.
I think that the vast majority of communities (and by community, I mean a place where people live -- distinct from a scene, or distinct from a club, or from a society) are within the philosophical framework of the Western Anarchist Tradition.

But I was shocked when I discovered Damanhur.  I didn't understand what underpinned it, but I saw that the results that they achieved were radically different.

Damanhur had the following things:
* 70% production of their own food and electricity.
* Built their own houses.
* Built their own tree-house society up in the trees.
* Had a functioning alternative currency.
* Had a tenuous, but functioning economy.
* Had incredible closeness.
* Had a way of life characterized by change and adventure.
* Had built enormous gorgeous temples underground.
* Self-taught themselves countless arts.
* Had achieved a way of living mythically in a modern context, that wasn't accepted uncritically, but was still engaged in actively.

In terms of raw achievements -- I have seen these longings in so many communities, but in Damanhur, they were actualities.

I think I participated in two efforts in Seattle to try and create working replicas of the Ithaca HOUR, an alternative currency effort in New York.
To date, I think something like 99% of alternative currency efforts fail.
I'm sure that Ithaca had a special sauce, that isn't known.
But Damanhur had it working trivially.
So I studied, "Why does Damanhur have this?"
"Why does Damanhur succeed at realizing all of these dreams, whereas most communities typically only realize the agricultural part, and stop there?"
And I went with Phil, who speaks Italian, and had visited some 20 communities prior.
And what I found there, was not a set of agreements --
It wasn't: "Let's agree to exchange with one another, in mutually beneficial relationships,"
What I found was a mystery school.
And I came to find that every visionary society, has a mystery school at its core.
It's true for Findhorn (RIP), and it's true for Tamera.
So I think that the question at root is about:  "Is it about dream?  Or is it about some ideal about fairness?"
I think every person has to ask themselves that question, and that that question sorts people into what they do in their life.
At least, that is how it looks to me, from my vantage point.
So, I want to encourage people to make big dreams come true.
Big dreams can come about through individuals, and Big dreams can come about through groups of people who are working together.
Where big dreams come about within communities, it typically comes about because of either (A) an individual who inspires people, or (B) a group of people who are inspired by some idea, and inspiring others with that idea as well.
I am thinking of like Steve Jobs as an example of (A), and thinking of like -- the founding fathers of the United States, as an example of (B).
I do not distinguish between the two.  I do not favor the group over the individual, and I do not favor the individual over the group.
What I favor, is the inspiration.
Inspiration is not of a universally equal moral plane.  I think that the inspiration behind the United States of America was good.  I think that the inspiration behind the Third Reich was evil.
So, it's not just about inspiration for inspiration's sake -- I believe that it has a necessarily moral quality to it.
But, ...  OK, so what am I saying here, ...
For me, inspiration is where I live.  It is my home.  It is the language that my soul knows, and speaks.
If I die in Songaia, I will be very unhappy.  I cannot do "community for communities sake."  It falls apart for me, in my heart and in my mind.
I think that I have a fundamentally religious character.  My soul finds fulfillment, only in God, and God is not a full belly.  That is not the miracle that sits in the center of life.  Not in my book.
Inspiration for me is not a "feeling."  It is not just something to be felt and enjoyed, like a good movie.  Rather, it is something like a causal force;  I relate far more to the idea from Shinto, of "The Infinite Restlessness of the Kami," and the purpose-filled connectedness of Musubi, rather than the Buddhist ideal of "inner peace and detachment," and the Hindu practice of abstaining from Karma.
So, -...  A lot of text.  Sorry for typing so much.  But I just had to kind of experientially say that;  I couldn't just think and say something short.
I think the consequences of my thinking, is something like the following:
* I am perfectly fine with hierarchies.  Hierarchies do not bother me.  The critical question I ask is, "What is the thing for?"
* I think that new religious forms are going to arise.  I don't think that they will look like the older religious forms, because we've had a huge scientific awakening in the last 500 years.  But I think that it's a cat that can't stay in the bag.
* I think that the new religious forms will have a humanistic character.  I think that they will answer questions about the individual vs. the whole, reason/rationality vs. the irrational, and consciousness and value/stories vs. matter.
Now on the one hand, people have been predicting this for more than 100 years.
I've got Rudolf Eucken's book right next to me, and he was saying these things in 1900.
But I think that 100 years is a very short time, on the world scale.
God only just died a short while ago.

A mystery school is an organized experientially based spiritual training.
Mystery schools typically begin with an injunction that I call the "Mystery School Boilerplate Text" that reads something like:
"Don't trust anything we say just because we say it; Rather, test these ideas in the laboratory of your life, and identify whether they are true through your own experience."
Mystery schools differ from exoteric religions (and typically, mystery schools explicate some kind of a delineation between the  esoteric and the exoteric) in that exoteric religions focus on creeds, symbols, worship, whereas esoteric religions focus on observation, understanding, and discovery.
Christian orthodoxies today decry Gnosticism specifically for it's belief in "secret knowledge;" Matthew 13 I think undermines this criticism, I find abundant evidence in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, that Jesus Christ established a mystery school.  I don't say this to specifically valorize Christianity over other religions;  I say it because I think it's an interesting point in the study of "What is a mystery school?", and in anticipation of anti-Gnostic challenges.
There are some traditions (it's very rare!) that have both an Esoteric and an Exoteric dimension, and where they are built in support of one another.  One of the most peculiar religions is the Cao Dai.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodaism
I learned about Cao Dai because I had a Hmong co-worker who told me about it and explained their beliefs, which I then went on to research.

Here's an example of the inner war within the Christian church, over Esotericism and Exotericism: https://www.gotquestions.org/Esoteric-Christianity.html

The fundamental issue as I see it is, "How does the population relate with itself, and the powers and insights that manifest within society?"

"If Jesus is over here teaching people spiritual insights, and there are other people who don't care or don't get it, but are sympathetic enough, how do all of these people relate to one another?"

We can look at this outside of the bounds of Christianity -- or any religion at all.
Look at contemporary human society.
There's a sub-population of adult society that is literate.  They certainly don't come to the same conclusions about things, but they're literate.
And then there's a population of adult society that is not literate.  And don't have the inner equipment to feel motivated to reason about various things.
Very similar dynamics are at work.
It's like the difference between a scientist, who is literate in science, who has walked and talked with other scientists, and pseudo-scientists, who are so uninformed, that they don't know that they are uninformed, and such.
Human societies have to deal and cope with the distribution of knowledge in the society.
It's not different when the knowledge is about psycho-spiritual matters.

"how does a particular group interact/see/deal with its outgroup"?

Yes.  The Damanhurians -- they are very homogenous in that:  To become a Damanhurian, you do so through the Mystery School.  It's focus is (1.) the Mystery School, first, (2.) the Community, second.  Community is an essential feature of their mystery school, actually -- they view life as fundamentally communal in nature, and that human community is just a natural reflection of the divine community.  (I am highly sympathetic to this, myself.)  So they are more "even-footed."  But you can't say, "I want the community, but let's leave the mystery school out of it."  That doesn't work, at all, at Damanhur.

The early Christians had a stratified society.  There were people Jesus Christ hung out with, and then there were the hoards of followers.  I'm not sure how they managed that, but there is clear evidence in the stories of Matthew Mark Luke and John that there was some kind of a church hierarchy.

The Cai Dao have an explicit system of exotericism and esotericism.  When kids show some kind of leaning towards the esoteric side, they are recognized and invited to esoteric study -- the inner meanings behind the signs and symbols, and an inner life of exploration and development within esoteric community.  They also consciously create a system of ritual, signs, symbols, celebrations, for the general public, who are "in," but who don't relate to ideas in quite the same way, and who are important to the social life of the spiritual community and who compose the majority of the Cai Dao population.  At least, this is what I construe from my remote study of the Cai Dao, and my talks with Triet.

Maybe it's not so much: "How does the group interact with the outgroup," but rather, "How does the group interact with the divisions within its in-group?"
Something that we all saw right away in Star Community is that:  Not everybody can do everything.  And we're not just talking about things like "who knows how to cook" and "who knows how to fix computers" -- there are people who are skilled in holding group space, there are people who make persuasive cases, there are people who can see things about other people better than anybody else, there are people who can hold logistics pieces and be trusted not to drop anything, there are people who are strategists, etc.,.  There are all of these different capacities people have.  People have different bases of intellectual knowledge, and people have different emotional and temperament ranges.  Some transformations are possible, but it is not easy.

Participating in live-in missional community really led me to have a profound respect for the public education system in the United States.
We dump on it all of the time, and there's plenty to complain about, but it does get some things done, and they are not easy things to do.
Having a "sufficiently shared narrative" is something that it does, and communicating some basic life and operational skills, like reading, writing, and some history.
It's like: "There's a lot of work we don't have to do," because people already have been exposed to a lot of ideas.
People have read 1984, they've read Animal Farm, they've heard one of MLK's speeches, they know something about US history, etc.,.
They know who Atticus Finch is.
For all the failures and deficiencies, -- when you face the prospect of "teaching it all by yourself," spending say 10 years teaching comprehensive history classes,
which means basically doing nothing else for 10 years but just that, -- it gives me some appreciation.
I'm especially grateful that there has been systematic education on propaganda, on reason and rationality, on logic, proof construction, etc.,.
Only a percentage of the population will be able to absorb the nutrients, but it's essential that people get the exposure,
and that the children who can absorb those nutrients do so.
When I was younger, I criticized the education system for not getting everybody to high marks in everything.
But now I look at education as more of a "spray" type phenomenon.
Children are not blank slates, they are very different.  And what I think the childhood education system does,
is try to expose kids to the things that they can connect up with and develop.  Also that there is something in a child
that seeks and attaches itself to the things it needs.  Like, food digestion in human beings proactively goes after the food --
Something in the child proactively goes for the nutrients if they are there.
