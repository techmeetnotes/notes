## A shared space for long-form discussion

Context: we already have Discord, this is in addition to Discord.

Constraints:
* Easy to export
* Durable format (e.g. plain text, markdown, simple html)
* Easy to remix, revise (excludes chat UIs like Discord, Slack)
* Can be browsed offline (excludes UIs like Discourse, Zulip)
* History is in a git repo (excludes MediaWiki, etc.)

Everybody's top preference:
* bouncepaw: I don't really care about git, I just want it to be easy to read and write.
* Ciprian: a git repo containing immutable published long-form documents in
  CommonMark.
* Kartik: a git repo containing plain text notes with relationships (links)
  between them. Build little tools for ourselves when needed to
  understand/communicate the big picture.

* Luke:

Everybody's goals:
* bouncepaw: See where this goes to. I would be delighted if this ends up as a cool
  repository with cool information, a maze of information.
* Ciprian: Volume control so that conversations are easy to catch up on after
  the fact.
* Kartik: Iterative summarization of what we learned, so that conversations
  can build up on each other rather than repeating themselves.
