## What Lion's been up to

2022-12-07

Programming:
* Technical Agenda 2023 -- ("2023" doesn't mean, "This is my agenda for the year 2023."  Rather, it means, "This is my technical agenda, as I see it from the vantage point of the year 2023.")  I realized that if I want my work to add up to something, I need to have a vision document and it needs to contain the various goals and sub-projects that add up to the bigger things.  This document is 13 pages long, and will likely be 30 pages long by the end of 2023.
* revisiting FileTalk -- I know, I've jumped back and forth on this one, and... After working with RabbitMQ for a bit, I realized, "Wait, this is a mismatch for how I'm approaching this."
* further developing my theory of interactive desktop computing, notekeeping, and maturing/enriching -- somewhat described in M42 in Technical Agenda 2023
* documentation bonanza -- I documented 5 of my prior modules, because I realized that while I have all this great code, I am not using it across projects nearly enough, and the reason is that I don't have convenient documents describing how they work, so I took out several days and wrote up nice API documentation for several of my projects.  I can already feel the difference.
* wrote "multiwork" -- a workflow system that makes it easier for me to work on different components (from different repositories) of a vertical stack, concurrently, while integrated together; it's kind of a "horizontal" check-in/check-out system, where the code from multiple repositories share a directory together
* Jump JSON -- I worked more on Jump JSON, after splitting it out of other projects, and it's pretty rich, but I feel like it's only 70% there;  "Jump JSON" is JSON that has substitutions like `["*JMP", "../foo.txt"]` that are replaced with jump instructions that can be manually or automatically obeyed by a cursor
* manual tests -- I've been following the idea Kartik suggested -- writing brief manual test suites, and absolutely love it
* RabbitMQ -- I deepened my understanding of RabbitMQ

Fun stuff:
* Swords of Glass -- http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Reviews/SwordsOfGlass/Index.html
* D100 Space by Martin Knight -- https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/406842/D100-Space-Book-1
* TTRPGs -- ran my own invention with Ayden & Susie, who had a great time; this is a big deal for me
  -- main ideas: the use of unit blocks and featureless pawns to communicate scene and activity, and separately modeling two modes of combat:  "generic" ("I attack the bat") and "narrative" ("I duck, and swing my sword aiming for his leg")
* TTRPGs -- exploring Rahm & Hillmer's radically different and homespun style of role playing games -- https://spacegamer.com/default.aspx
* Star Wars: Andor -- absolutely loved it; shocked to love something Star Wars after Disney+

Society of Dream:
* Wrote an outline document for my philosophy, but it hasn't been a primary focus, and is very brief so far.  I hate to say it, but it hasn't been at the center of my attention.  I feel much more called to my programming work presently.
* I've been connecting with a new, fairly sexually open, polyamorous community, that I'm just getting to know.  It's not a perfect match, but I've been surprised by how open they are, and I've seen quite a lot in my days, so I am studying them and how they operate.
